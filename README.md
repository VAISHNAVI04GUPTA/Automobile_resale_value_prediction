## About the Project
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the resale price of used cars based on various features such as mileage, age, fuel type, transmission, and other relevant details. This type of prediction model is useful for online car sales platforms, car dealerships, and buyers interested in accurate pricing insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information about cars’ specifications and their prices. Key features in the dataset may include:
- **Age**: The age of the car in years
- **Mileage**: The number of miles driven
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric)
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission (e.g., manual, automatic)
- **Brand/Model**: The make and model of the car

Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format to run the code.

```

## Requirements
To install the required Python libraries, use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Libraries typically used in this project include:
- `pandas` - for data manipulation
- `numpy` - for numerical computations
- `scikit-learn` - for machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - for data visualization
- `xgboost` - for gradient boosting model implementation (optional)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-car-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd used-car-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Download and place the dataset in the `data` folder.
2. Open the `Used_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building steps.
4. Alternatively, use `src/model.py` to directly train and evaluate the model from the command line.

## Modeling Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Visualize data distributions to gain insights on influential features.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identify and select the most relevant features to improve model accuracy.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluate their performance.
   - Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Measure model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results
The model with the best performance was selected based on its evaluation metrics. The final model’s predictions show a high degree of accuracy in estimating car prices, with a good balance between bias and variance.

| Model          | RMSE  | R²    |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| Linear Model   | 0.43  | 0.77  |      
| Random Forest  | 0.39  | 0.80  |       
| XGBoost        | 0.39  | 0.81  |       


## Future Work
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrate additional features like car location, seller type, and accident history for more accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Package the model as an API for real-time predictions.
- **Advanced Models**: Experiment with deep learning models to capture complex relationships in the data.
